# DataAnalyticsAPI
Data Analytics using SK-learn &amp; Pandas

I have made an API for DataAnalytics such as Linear Regression, these methods are performed on Collections within a MongoDB.
The results of the Methods will be returned to the screen via FastAPI for further use (by the user).

Eventually i will move this into container that contains the MongoDB alone side.
